# quarterly_earning_analysis

Utilized object-oriented design and developed C++ program that dynamically downloads 90 days before and after quarterly earnings for all Russel 3000 stocks. Optimized code using low-latency concepts to keep runtime of entire project below 2 min.

Implemented bootstrapping and calculated metrics like Abnormal Returns (AR) against IWV, Average AR, and Cumulative AR and STD. Classified the 3000 stocks into 3 groups and plotted graphs to show expected and actual change in price.
